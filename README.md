# ExpressVPN Keys to BitWarden Conditioner (Deno)

A simple, quickly cobbled up solution I needed trying to migrate away from this more obscure Password Manager, to BitWarden.

## Dependencies
- Deno

## Usage instructions
- Make a copy of the `./in/expressvpn_data.csv.dist` file and rename it to `./in/expressvpn_data.csv`
- Paste your ExpressVPN Keys export data there.
- Or just straight up put your exported file into the `./in/` directory.
- run main.ts
- upload the file generated in `./out/`or its contents.

## Current support
- Currently supporting login and notes

## Coming Soon (surely)
- Support for cc details.

The End -- run free.
